Instructions on Opening the Application
1. Open Habit@ on your Android device or emulator. Ensure that you have a working internet connection.
2. First the splash page opens and then takes you to the login front screen where 2 buttons are visible. A register button and a login button.
3. You may choose either path. 
	a. If the login path is chosen, login with peter.liu@example.com or sandeep@example.ca these are both valid accounts.
	b. If the register path is chosen then fill out the forms and continue.
4. In the register path ensure that the dropdowns are populated before continuing. Data is being fetched from a webservice here.
5. Once the registration is complete you will be taken to the Dashboard that renders an OPEN GL version of earth spinning around.
6. There is a profile page button at the top right corner of the screen that you can use to navigate between profile page and dashboard.
